# 🚦 Lighthouse Runner

### ℹ️ What is this?

'Lighthouse Runner' is a CLI that lets you run Lighthouse programmatically for a given URL and a given number of times.
At the end of all of the runs, it will provide a detailed report of the average Lighthouse scores for your website.
It will do that for 3 different configurations: ideal, average and worst-case, to ensure that all possible conditions are covered.

### 🏁 Getting started

If this is the first time that you're running the tool:
1. Make sure that you have [Deno](https://deno.com/) installed on your machine.
2. Execute the following command to install the dependencies:
```bash
deno install
```

Once everything is set up, run the tool with the following command.
It will ask you for a URL and the number of times you would like to run the test.

```bash
npm run start
```
